    <h2>PAKAGES IN PLSQL</h2>
    <h4>n PL/SQL, a package is a schema object that groups related procedures, functions, variables, cursors, and other PL/SQL constructs into a single unit. Packages provide a way to organize and modularize code within the database schema, making it easier to manage and maintain complex applications</h4>
    <h2>CHARACTERISTICS OF PACKAGES</h2>
    <h3>
    <pre>In PL/SQL, packages provide a way to organize and modularize code within the database schema. Let's explore the characteristics of packages:

        .Logical Grouping:Packages allow you to logically group related PL/SQL constructs together.
        
        .Encapsulation:Packages encapsulate implementation details, hiding the internal logic and complexity from the calling code.
        
        .Public and Private Components:Packages can contain both public and private components. Public components are accessible from outside the package, while private components are only accessible within the package itself.
        
        .Specification and Body:A package consists of two parts: the package specification and the package body. The specification defines the public interface of the package, while the body contains the implementation.
        
        .Persistent State:Package variables maintain their state across multiple invocations of the procedures and functions within the package.
        
        .Improved Performance:Packages can improve performance by reducing the overhead associated with parsing and optimizing code.</pre>
