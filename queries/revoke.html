    <h2>Revoking Permissions from users</h2>
    <h4>In MySQL, the REVOKE statement is used to revoke previously granted privileges from users or roles. It
        effectively removes specific privileges from a user, limiting their access to certain databases, tables, or
        columns. Here's the basic syntax:</h4>
    <h2>syntax...</h2>
    <p>
        <code>REVOKE privileges ON database_name.table_name FROM 'user'@'host';</code>

    </p>
    <h4>Replace privileges with the specific privileges you want to revoke, database_name.table_name with the name of
        the database and table (or * for all tables) you want to revoke access from, and 'user'@'host' with the username
        and host for the user you want to revoke access from.</h4>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <h3>
        <pre>
            1. Example to revoke SELECT privileges on all tables in the school database to a user named 'john' from localhost:

               REVOKE SELECT ON school.* TO 'john'@'localhost';

            2. Example to revoke multiple privileges at once:

               REVOKE SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON school.* TO 'john'@'localhost';

            3. Example to revoke all privileges on all tables in the school database to a user named 'john' from localhost:

               REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON school.* TO 'john'@'localhost';

            4. Example to revoke all privileges on all databases to a user named 'john' from localhost:

               REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'john'@'localhost';
