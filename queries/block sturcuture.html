    <h2>we will discuss the Basic Syntax of PL/SQL which is a block-structured language; this means that the PL/SQL programs are divided and written in logical blocks of code. Each block consists of three sub-parts −</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>S no.</th>
            <th>Section and description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Declarations-

                This section starts with the keyword DECLARE. It is an optional section and defines all variables, cursors, subprograms, and other elements to be used in the program.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>Executable Commands-

                This section is enclosed between the keywords BEGIN and END and it is a mandatory section. It consists of the executable PL/SQL statements of the program. It should have at least one executable line of code, which may be just a NULL command to indicate that nothing should be executed.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>Exception Handling-

                This section starts with the keyword EXCEPTION. This optional section contains exception(s) that handle errors in the program.</td>
        </tr>
        
    </table>
    <h2>Every PL/SQL statement ends with a semicolon (;). PL/SQL blocks can be nested within other PL/SQL blocks using BEGIN and END. Following is the basic structure of a PL/SQL block −</h2>
    <p>
        <code>DECLARE 
            <br>
            <declarations section> 
                <br>
         BEGIN 
         <br>
            <executable command(s)>
         EXCEPTION 
         <br>
            <exception handling> 
                <br>
         END;
